Hello dearest visitor, and thanks for being one,

I'm a Micronaut and together with my buddy Aleh we are hereby sharing things mostly about [music](/music){:target="_blank"} and [stories](/blog){:target="_blank"}.  You will find here content either in English or Greek, depending pretty much on our mood.

Aleh studied physics, electrical engineering, and medical informatics. He currently earns his bread (mine as well) as software engineer in the Healthcare IT sector. But I guess this is not why you are here, is it? At least you will be frustrated to find here only tiny traces of technical topics, and always well woven in Aleh's stories. He prefers to narrate fictional stories you see, but alas his free time is very limited, even for that. He is trying his best, though, for that I can tell.

As for myself, the Micronaut, I sail into the oceans of the human mind. Most of the time you will find me traveling in the 4th dimension of music. I'm not able to identify a music genre that describes my tastes. Yet, I have a rather biased preference towards dark folk, dark/gothic rock & ambient sounds. Definitely I'm very fastidious when it comes to mainstream pop music, as much as Aleh is. In case you are interested in my music taste, you might better check my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/AL3x4ndros){:target="_blank"} profile. I assume your first reaction is that  I'm a product of imagination. Well, think again dear visitor, for I'm very privileged to be surrounded by [friends](/links){:target="_blank"}, real and virtual.  After all, reality and imagination is just  different projections of the same mind, only to help us survive.

Regarding the deployment of this blog, we chose one of the most promising bloging platforms to date, that is Jekyll on Github pages. We find it delightful to post simple text files instead of bulky database entries. The chosen theme is the ['So Simple Theme'](http://mademistakes.com/so-simple/){:target="_blank"} by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com){:target="_blank"}. Michael has created a simple yet awesome theme, and he definitely deserves compliments for his work. As a proper software engineer would do, Aleh has modified Michael's theme, in order to accommodate our needs. Among others, he incorporated the [responsive-timeline](https://github.com/brunodsgn/responsive-timeline){:target="_blank"} styles by Bruno Rodrigues, which you can check [here](/music/new-albums-2015/){:target="_blank"}. Next to that, Aleh has added also some javascript (poor guy still struggling with this language) to load certain type of content only when is supposed to be displayed in your browser; he did that to save your bandwidth in case you visit a page that happens to contain plenty of photos and iframes. Last but not least, you can spend some time in the [404](/404){:target="_blank"} page. You can find a (more complete) list of modification in the [theme-setup](/theme-setup/#alehs-customizations) page.

Welcome to our adventures.<br/>
Have fun and respect others,<br/>

    <figcaption>Dear little lad<br/>
Here's the story of my life<br/> 
I lived on the moon (2x)<br/>
Grey flying snakes along<br/>
Mountains of destiny while<br/>
the three tailed moneys<br/>
were drawing the stars<br/>
Light from the Sun<br/>
and I hide myself<br/>
on the dark side, alone<br/>
I've run so far,<br/>
to find my way<br/>
Then I dream again.. alone<br/>
<br/>
Dear little boy, listen<br/>
To voices of your soul<br/>
It showed you the way of<br/>
silence and peace<br/>
Follow your thought and fly<br/>
Choosing all the things<br/>
that you desire<br/>
Giant waves, fireflies..<br/>
Your dream will be<br/>
your only shell<br/>
Your secrets,<br/>
your hiding place, my son<br/>
Don't let them try<br/>
To crush your brain<br/>
Let you go far ...my son</figcaption>
