Hello dearest visitor, and thanks for being one,

I'm a Micronaut and together with my buddy Aleh we are hereby sharing things mostly about music and storytelling. Depending pretty much on our mood,  you will find content either in English or in Greek. 

Aleh studied (high energy & particle) physics, electrical engineering, medical informatics, and currently earns his bread (mine as well) as software engineer in Healthcare IT sector. But who cares about all that stuff? If it happens you seek content related to these areas, you will be frustrated to find here only tiny traces of it, and always well woven in his stories. You see, Aleh loves to write or to narrate stories, but alas his free time is very limited. He is trying his best, though, for that I can tell.

As for the Micronaut, I sail into the oceans of the human mind. Most of the time you will find me travelling in the 4th dimension of music. I'm not able to identify a music genre that describes my tastes. Yet, I have a rather biased preference towards dark folk, dark/gothic rock & ambient sounds. Definitely I'm very fastidious when it comes to mainstream pop music, as much as Aleh is. If you are curious about my taste in music you might best check my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/AL3x4ndros){:target="_blank"} profile. I'm also very privileged to be surrounded by [friends](/links){:target="_blank"} (real or online) with great taste in music. 

Regarding the deployment of this blog, I chose one of the most promising available bloging platforms nowadays, that is Jekyll on Github. I find it very exciting to post text files instead of bulky database entries. As for the theme, I chose the ['So Simple Theme'](http://mademistakes.com/so-simple/){:target="_blank"} by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com){:target="_blank"}. Michael has done a great job here, and I think he deserves our compliments. I slightly modified his theme, though, in order to accommodate my needs. Among others, I've incorporated the [responsive-timeline](https://github.com/brunodsgn/responsive-timeline){:target="_blank"} by Bruno Rodrigues, which you can [here](/blog/new-albums-2015/){:target="_blank"}.

Have fun and respect others,<br/>
Aleh and the Micronaut

    <figcaption>Dear little lad<br/>
Here's the story of my life<br/> 
I lived on the moon (2x)<br/>
Grey flying snakes along<br/>
Mountains of destiny while<br/>
The three tailed moneys<br/>
Were drawing the stars<br/>
Light from the Sun and I<br/>
Hide myself on the dark side, alone<br/>
I've run so far, to find my way<br/>
Then I dream again.. alone<br/>
<br/>
Dear little boy, listen<br/>
To voices of your soul<br/>
It showed you the way of<br/>
Silence and peace<br/>
Follow your thought and fly<br/>
Choosing all the things that you desire<br/>
Giant waves, fireflies..<br/>
Your dream will be your only shell<br/>
Your secrets, your hiding place, my son<br/>
Don't let them try<br/>
To crush your brain<br/>
Let you go far ...my son</figcaption>
