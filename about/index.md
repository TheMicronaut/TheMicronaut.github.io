Hello dearest visitor, and thanks for being one,

I'm a Micronaut and together with my buddy Aleh we are hereby sharing things mostly about [music](/music){:target="_blank"} and [stories](/blog){:target="_blank"}. Depending pretty much on our mood,  you will find content either in English or in Greek. 

Aleh studied (high energy & particle) physics, electrical engineering, and medical informatics. He currently earns his daily bread (mine as well) as software engineer in Healthcare IT sector. But who cares about all this? You will be rather frustrated to find here only few tiny traces of this staff, and always well woven in Aleh's stories. He prefers to narrate stories, you see, but alas his free time is quite limited. He is trying his best, though, for that I can tell.

As for myself, the Micronaut, I sail into the oceans of the human mind. Most of the time you will find me travelling in the 4th dimension of music. I'm not able to identify a music genre that describes my tastes. Yet, I have a rather biased preference towards dark folk, dark/gothic rock & ambient sounds. Definitely I'm very fastidious when it comes to mainstream pop music, as much as Aleh is. In case you are interested in my music taste, you might better check my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/AL3x4ndros){:target="_blank"} profile. I'm also very privileged to be surrounded by [friends](/links){:target="_blank"} (both real and virtual) with great taste in music. 

Regarding the deployment of this blog, I chose one of the most promising bloging platforms to date, that is Jekyll on Github pages. I find it just great  to post text files instead of bulky database entries. The chosen theme is the simple yet beatiful ['So Simple Theme'](http://mademistakes.com/so-simple/){:target="_blank"} by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com){:target="_blank"}. Michael has done a great job here, and he definetly deserves compliments. As a proper software engineer would do, Aleh has (slightly) modified Michael's theme, in order to accommodate our needs. Among others, he incorporated the [responsive-timeline](https://github.com/brunodsgn/responsive-timeline){:target="_blank"} styles by Bruno Rodrigues, which you can check [here](/music/new-albums-2015/){:target="_blank"}.

Welcome to our adventures.<br/>
Have fun and respect others,<br/>
Aleh and the Micronaut

    <figcaption>Dear little lad<br/>
Here's the story of my life<br/> 
I lived on the moon (2x)<br/>
Grey flying snakes along<br/>
Mountains of destiny while<br/>
the three tailed moneys<br/>
were drawing the stars<br/>
Light from the Sun<br/>
and I hide myself<br/>
on the dark side, alone<br/>
I've run so far,<br/>
to find my way<br/>
Then I dream again.. alone<br/>
<br/>
Dear little boy, listen<br/>
To voices of your soul<br/>
It showed you the way of<br/>
silence and peace<br/>
Follow your thought and fly<br/>
Choosing all the things<br/>
that you desire<br/>
Giant waves, fireflies..<br/>
Your dream will be<br/>
your only shell<br/>
Your secrets,<br/>
your hiding place, my son<br/>
Don't let them try<br/>
To crush your brain<br/>
Let you go far ...my son</figcaption>
