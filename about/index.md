Hello dearest visitor, and thanks for visiting. I'm Aleh and together with my buddy, the Micronaut, we are sharing things mainly about music and stories. Sometimes you will find content in English, and other times in Greek. 

Myself, I've studied (high energy & particle) physics, electrical engineering, and medical informatics, and currently I work as software engineer in Healthcare IT sector. But I assume you don't care about all this. If you also search for this type of content here, you will probably be frustrated, as you will find only tiny traces of it.

Most of the time you will find me travelling in the 4th dimension of music. I'm not able to identify a music genre that describes my tastes. Yet, I have a rather biased preference towards dark folk, dark/gothic rock & ambient sounds. Definitely I'm very difficult when it comes to mainstream pop music. If you are curious about my musical taste, you could best check my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/AL3x4ndros){:target="_blank"} profile. I'm also very privileged to be surrounded by [friends](/links){:target="_blank"} (real or online) with great taste in music. 

Regarding the deployment of this blog, I chose one of the most promising available bloging platforms nowadays, that is Jekyll on Github. I find it very exciting that one can post by simply uploading text files. For the theme, I chose the ['So Simple Theme'](http://mademistakes.com/so-simple/){:target="_blank"} by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com){:target="_blank"}. I slightly modified this theme to accommodate my needs.


If you wish to contact me further, you can use the links at the bottom.

Have fun,
Aleh, and the Micronaut
