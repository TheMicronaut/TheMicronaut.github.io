Dearest visitor, welcome and thanks for being one,

I'm a Micronaut and together with my buddy Aleh we are hereby sharing things about [music](/music){:target="_blank"},  [fiction](/stories){:target="_blank"} and sometimes about our [views and daily life](/blog){:target="_blank"}.  You will find content either in English or Greek, depending pretty much on our mood. You will not find much of photos or other sparkling visual pleasures (perhaps only some live concert photoshooting, or a picture if and when needed); the focus here is, therefore, mainly on thoughts and sounds. 

Aleh studied physics, electrical engineering, and medical informatics. Currently he earns his bread (mine as well) as software engineer in the Healthcare IT sector. But I guess this is not why you are here, is it? At least you will be frustrated to find only traces of technical topics, and always well woven in his stories. You see, Aleh prefers to write fictional stories, but alas his free time is little and precious. He is trying his best, though, for that I can tell.

As for myself the Micronaut, I sail the oceans of human minds but most of the time you will find me in the 4th dimension of music. I'm not able to identify a music genre that describes my tastes. Yet, I have a rather biased preference towards dark folk, dark/gothic rock & ambient sounds. Definitely I'm very fastidious when it comes to mainstream pop music, as much as Aleh is. In case you are interested in my music taste, you might better check our [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/AL3x4ndros){:target="_blank"} profile. I assume your first reaction is that  I'm a product of imagination. Maybe you are right dear visitor, but then again I would challenge you to amend your thoughts, as reality and imagination are just different projections of the same mind. The Kwoon's embedded song below narrates the story of my life...

Regarding the deployment of this site, we chose one of the most promising blogging platforms to date, that is Jekyll on Github pages. We find it delightful to post simple text files instead of bulky database entries. The chosen theme is the ['So Simple Theme'](http://mademistakes.com/so-simple/){:target="_blank"} by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com){:target="_blank"}. Michael has created an awesome yet simple theme, and he definitely deserves compliments for his work. 

As a proper software engineer would do, Aleh has [modified](/theme-setup/#alehs-customizations) Michael's theme, in order to accommodate our needs. Among others, he incorporated the [responsive-timeline](https://github.com/brunodsgn/responsive-timeline){:target="_blank"} styles by Bruno Rodrigues (check [here](/music/new-albums-2015/){:target="_blank"}). Next to that, Aleh has been messing around with javascript (poor guy still struggling with it) to load certain type of content only when is supposed to be displayed in your browser; he did that to save your bandwidth in case you visit a page that happens to contain plenty of photos and iframes. Last but not least, you can spend some time in the [404](/404){:target="_blank"} page. You can find an (attempt for a) list of customizations in our [theme-setup](/theme-setup/#alehs-customizations) page.

If you wish to contact us, feel free to use one of the links at the bottom (footer).

Welcome to our adventures. Have fun and respect others,<br/>

    <figcaption>Dear little lad<br/>
Here's the story of my life<br/> 
I lived on the moon (2x)<br/>
Grey flying snakes along<br/>
Mountains of destiny while<br/>
the three tailed moneys<br/>
were drawing the stars<br/>
Light from the Sun<br/>
and I hide myself<br/>
on the dark side, alone<br/>
I've run so far,<br/>
to find my way<br/>
Then I dream again.. alone<br/>
<br/>
Dear little boy, listen<br/>
To voices of your soul<br/>
It showed you the way of<br/>
silence and peace<br/>
Follow your thought and fly<br/>
Choosing all the things<br/>
that you desire<br/>
Giant waves, fireflies..<br/>
Your dream will be<br/>
your only shell<br/>
Your secrets,<br/>
your hiding place, my son<br/>
Don't let them try<br/>
To crush your brain<br/>
Let you go far ...my son</figcaption>
