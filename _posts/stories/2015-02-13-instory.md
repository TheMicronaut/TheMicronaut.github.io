**Note 1:** Here is a fictional story I <s>wrote</s> am still writing through my own instagram photos. The story develops as I go through the year and I still have no clue what the ending will look like. The photos are taken either from my daily life or while visiting places. Usually I feed the story realtime, but occasionally I need to add photos I shot previously, for the sake of coherence.

**Note 2:** The images are sorted from newest to oldest, due to some limitations of instagram's API in combination with the javascript script that pulls the images from instagram. Therefore, you need to click the [load more](#instafeed-load-more) button below, to load the oldest images and then you can start reading the story from bottom upwards. I'm working to find a better solution for this.
