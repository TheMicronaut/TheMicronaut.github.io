**Note 1:** Here is a fictional story I <s>wrote</s> am still writing through my own Instagram photos. The story develops as I go through the year and I still have no clue what the ending will look like. The photos are taken either from my daily life or while visiting places. Usually I feed the story real-time, but occasionally I need to add photos I shot previously, for the sake of coherence.

The story might possibly make sense only if you read it from [bottom](#comments) to top.  I'm struggling to find a better solution for this.
