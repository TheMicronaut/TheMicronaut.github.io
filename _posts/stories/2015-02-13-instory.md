**Note 1:** Here is a fictional story I <s>wrote</s> am still writing through my own instagram photos. The story develops as I go through the year and I still have no clue what the ending will look like, or even its title. The photos are taken either from my daily life or while visiting places. Usually I feed the story realtime, but occasionally I need to add photos I shot previously, for the sake of coherence. The instagram feed has been ordered chronologically so that one can follow the storyline.
