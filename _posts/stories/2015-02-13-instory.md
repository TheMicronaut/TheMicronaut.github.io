**Note 1:** Here is a fictional story I <s>wrote</s> am still writing through my own instagram photos. The story develops as I go through the year and I still have no clue what the ending will look like. The photos are taken either from my daily life or while visiting places. Usually I feed the story realtime, but occasionally I need to add photos I shot previously, for the sake of coherence.

To read the story, you need to click the [load more](#instafeed-load-more) button below, so that the oldest images to be loaded and then you can start reading the story from bottom upwards. I'm working to find a better solution for this.

<div id="instafeed"></div>
<div class="pagination"><a id="instafeed-load-more" class="btn" role="button">Load more</a></div>
