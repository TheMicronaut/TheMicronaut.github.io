Lavina Meijer is a Dutch harpist with increasing popularity. First time I met her at cross-lynx festival, in Eindhoven, February 2014. Back then, I was impressed by her performance and particularly by her Karma Police cover (Radiohead) (check here for an older performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzBds8f3TXE). She openly admires Philips Glass (here we've got something in common) and covers many of his piano songs (Metamorphoses is one of her best known covers). This time she covered Olafur Arnalds, Wim Martens (Struggle for Pleasure is a track that gives me goosebumbs no matter how many times I listen to it). During her performances, the last track is always the moment of surprise. This time she covered part of the Apollo 13 movie soundtrack (adding her own talents and spices to it). You can check it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b5iB-7gGhM]

Not only 'Kiss the Anus of a Black Cat' is a name of a band, but actually it is one of my favorites. Belgian people, nice people. I knew them as a dark fork, dark rock band. They kept the rock and the dark parts but they have replaced the folk with more electronic elements. In Incubate 2015 they perfomed mostly their last album 'Weltuutergangsstimmung' (I guess translated sounds something like 'gloom and doom').

No banjo anymore... but still lovable... [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42TdycR0zMw]

Mark Kozelek is Mark Kozelek. He performed solo, he was (as expected) perfect, and nothing more to be said. I'm a lucky man to have seen him live ... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnv2y9cY2eE]

The Soft Moon is an american, relatively new post-punk band. I'd heard their work before, but as a not real fun of this genre, I never paid enough attention. And as pretty much always, it is enough to attend the first live performance in order to change one's mind. They performed, no news here, most songs of their latest (2015) album, yet honestly I've no clue how much and which of their older releases. The emotions are clearly captured in the fotos. They's a saying about people who started listening folk music first, they turn into rock/punk music and visa-versa. I started listening to rock, moved to folk and seems like I'm becoming a punk. I hope I'll be left with some hair in the end, to paint. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iigmNuZRlqU]

French are good (among others) in shoegazing / post-rock, and Alcest is one of their best representatives. Their 2014 album 'Shelter' still remains one of my favorites. The venue (Dudok at Tilburg), an old chapel transformed into a concert venue, is the ideal place for shoegazing, which actually Ι got myself engaged in. I spent some time, the truth is, staring at those boots without laces. Unfortunately I left the venue halfway (had to catch last trains and all), so I can't have a clear view on what they actually performed. The sound was superb though, at it fits to a superb post-rock band.

When one listens to something like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wL_JE_ksh8], one expects an indie, krautrock band. It is hard to accept, though, the fact that all these sounds come from machines and instruments controlled by a single person! British artist William Doyle is the only member of 'East India Youth'. He may be looking for someone in his song, but I believe he doesn't need anyone. He satisfied at once, both himself and his audience at once. You can see him in action, performing 'Turn Away' right here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdhbZ88UjD8]

Husky is an indie-folk band from Australia, and as I always have been saying, there might be something in the waters of Australia which renders people into great song writters.
The main singer, Husky Gawenda, wrote the songs for his band while walking around his neighbourhood and sitting at local coffee shops. Among others he confessed that his song 'Hunter' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67bjmpLHQAw] (which actually I enjoyed a lot), is a product of his recurrent nightmares related to a certain girl! 

I would never have known House of Wolves, if I didn't follow certain people online (this time credits go to Alevizon: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WfCt2x_Ff8]). I was severely attracted to their first album 'Fold in the Wind' (2013) and specially the tracks '50's' & 'Ageless'. The band's name from California comes actually from the singer's spanish last name (Rey Villalobos). In Incubate 2015 they performed without trumpet or piano, which rendered their sound even more delicate than it is already. The truth is, I missed both instruments, yet sweetness was still in the air. You can here the live performance of "50's" here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf_qRtQlwXs]

Torres (aka Mackenzie Scott) is just 24 years old. I was expecting a timid little girl, or something close to that. Moreover, thought she was 'brunette', at least from the photos and videos I saw. Well, nothing like that, at least in the appearances. My expectations matched the facts, though, when it came to sounds. I know her since here first album (2013) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa1cbq1Gqps] and she is great. She knows how to balance between darkness and light.
Torres and her band performed songs from her first album (Torres, 2013) but also from their new album (Sprinter, 2015) : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6SIw30IOt8]
By the way, I loved Mackenzie's socks!

There is a moment when you realise there is an 80's band which everyone (well, almost everyone) knows and you completely ignore. The feeling is even more devastating when you enter the venue, and see around 3000 people listening to Mercury Rev. It is the WTF moment. From Incubate's site, one reads : "Plenty of bands advocate anarchy, but few have practiced it with the single-minded determination of Mercury Rev, a psychedelically inclined sextet given over to every-man-for-himself excursions as open-ended as 'pop' music has seen in many years. At Incubate, Mercury Rev plays a exclusive show together with the Tilburg Conservatorium orchestra." How could I miss all that?
This American alternative-psychedelic-indie-pop-rock-whatever band has long history, aparently, and this is all future to me... During the concert, the band's frontman Jonathan Donahue explained the history behind the songs. I recall particularly the story behind the "Opus 40" from the 'Deserted Songs' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fusKcZjj7dg] which was written during a heavy storm, and in a period of darkness.

A band with double drumming is definitely something not to be missed. One of Finland's best dark-electonic, krautrock bands consists of three members, two of which are the drummers. They call their gender 'esoteric space rock', a term that made me laugh when I read it, yet five minutes of live performance is enough to convince yourself that it is true. I tried hard to decode some of their lyrics, but in the end I gave up, as I was getting lost deeper in their rhythms and melodies. Occasionally I was waiting patiently for the lovely moment when they cross hands, or drumsticks. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nV88Ks9Oys ]
Circle of Time! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odD-Nlc_Z34]

What would be a better place for King Dude (aka Thomas Jefferson Cowgill) to perform than a real church! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-8TkWJVMX8] A minimalistic protestant one, yet PaulusKerk in Tilburg's center is still a church. And no one doubts the church has never been so crowded. King Dude calls the music genre he advocates as 'Luciferian', actually a mix of folk, neofolk and darkfolk elements. King Dude loves spirituality, good or evil, and many of his songs are inspired by both. Yet one wonders is it really spirituallity about good or evil? One thing is certain, his music is spirituallity good. The concert opened with church's own organ intro by Burial Hex's Clay Ruby. For the rest he performed solo with his guitar with noticeable song "Jesus in the Courtyard" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiSnI8vyxx0 ]
The lighting and accoustics not being optimal (strange enough for a church), I heared him describing the difference between the modern Baptist churches he is familiar with and the one he was singing.

Sóley Stefánsdóttir and her band from Iceland was performing almost concurrently with King Dude, thus I had to steal the last 15 minutes from the later in order to attend 30 minutes of the first. They are both hard to resist, so the choice was tough! During her performance, Sóley asked the attendees whether they are going to have fun that night. Someone replied with a "certainly" word, only for her smiling Pretty Face [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRwFRMGpTWg] to change expression as she thought about her baby back in Iceland. Their performance was perfect, as expected. Suprime (almost like studio) sound quality even in an open area space.
"Ask the Deep" is the title of the new (2015) album from Soley. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boKo7yLyDn8] 

Cabaret Voltaire is nowadays just Richard H. Kirk, his machines & multi-screen projections. I was expecting a revival but the performance featured exclusively new material and nothing from the great avant-guarde past. I spent 20 minutes listening to this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDcRH0bCmQ] only to realize how lucky I am for my ears are not made for this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDcRH0bCmQ].

I'm not really fun of Funk or R&B music, yet there is this psychedelic/lo-fi element that attracts me to 'Unknown Mortal Orchestra'. This rather new band from New Zeeland/American band attracts more people by day. They played "old" and new songs.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEtDVy55shI] 

In a line-up with more than 300 artists/bands it is normal to surpass a name in the long lists. On my way back to the train station I passed by the pub "De Harmonie" and from he glass inside I noticed a rather familiar face singing on an adhoc stage. At once I looked at the agenda, only to realize it was her, Corrina Repp. Without a second thought I entered the venue. I've heard her work in the past, even liked her facebook page, but for some reason I hadn't realized she was performing at Incubate 2015. I still think it was one of the best performances in Incubate 2015. After her show (unfortunately, I only attended half of it), instead of disappearing, she came down the podium and offered drinks to some of her acquaintances. It was the only moment in the festival that I could exchange few words with an artist.

Canadian folk band Great Lake Swimmers opened my last Incubate day's performances. I like them as much as I love the sound of banjo, and particularly the sound of their banjo. Apparently in their last album (A Forest of Arms, 2015) they have put the banjo for a (hopefully short time) rest. They started with their new album with most noticeable the 'I Must Have Someone Else's Blues' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq8PiCkOQMg], for which frontman Tony Dekker asked the audience to sing along. Well, noone wants to mess around with someone else's blues, but still there were some of us singing along. I managed to record one of my favorite songs called 'Your Rocky Spine' from their third album (Ongiara) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-BlLlZ9eKg], but alas I had to leave before their finale so I could attend the next concert. I was actually waiting patiently to hear the all time favorite 'I could be nothing' but (I believe and hope) they kept it for the end. I wish I had more time with them...
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbHbleYeQRw] 

I believe any dark music lover met or at least knows danish Kim Larsen (aka Of the Wand & the Moon). He performed solo with his guitar, which I was staring for almost all 45 minutes of his perfomance. Can anyone decode what short of Runic is written on it and starts with "This..."? Kim with his magnetic voice and exceptional talent is capable of capturing his audience's attention even if someone is not attracted to his music style. It is enough to loose oneself in his lyrics and particular voice. He played songs from various albums with most noticeable 'I Crave For You' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBKj_IHog40] and 'Lost in Emptiness' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDVog7luAbY]. Kim was apparently thirsty during his concert, for he was drinking a sip of beer every other song, saying "Drinky time!". I love his spirit and his voice.

Empyrium is one of my favorite dark folk bands and the last to attend in Incubate. They performed full band in an open amphitheater in a forest, right after Of the Wand & the Moon. Most of the songs where from the latest albums (particularly Songs Of Moors and Misty Fields), whereas one of them entitled 'Mile' is released just a day before the concert.
Needless to describe the infinite joy I felt to the sound of their (and therefore my own private Incubate's) last song, my favorite waltz 'Many moons ago..." here in an older performance : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOxJrSkRqR4]
Life is, and will always be a waltz...
