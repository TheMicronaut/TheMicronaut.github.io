Located in the south of The Netherlands, the relatively small city of Tilburg (according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilburg){:target="_blank"} around 210,000 people) hosts Incubate one of the largest, in terms of participating acts, annual festivals of the country. The festival focuses mainly on music, although there is a (yearly increasing) number of other artistic activities taking place (film, theatre, debates, visual arts, contemporary dance, etc). Approximately 350 artists participated in 2015 edition, which took place across 39 small and big [venues](http://incubate.org/2015/venues){:target="_blank"} around the city's centre, between the 14th and the 20th of September. For a complete list of all participating acts, please refer to festival's [official page](http://incubate.org/2015/line-up){:target="_blank"}. 

Incubate's agenda is quite diverse, yet it focuses on acts beyond the outskirts of mainstream commercialism. The music style is what I simply call _eclectic alternative_. The organizers prefer to identify it as 'cutting edge'. But then again, when it comes to music, what really makes music sound alternative, or 'cutting-edge', or left-field[^1]? Far ahead of the glamour of other large-scale music festivals[^2], Incubate's best ingredient that makes all the difference is quality.  It doesn't come as a surprise that indie culture website The Quietus have called Incubate their "favourite festival".

As always, I chose the less travelled (therefore the more obscure) path, and in the following lines I'll try to describe you what I experienced. Remember that music taste is subjective, which implies that what you are about to read in the following lines is seasoned with my own spices.

My agenda opened with an artist I had seen live before. Lavina Meijer is a Dutch harpist with increasing popularity. The first time I met her was at Eindhoven's Cross-Lynx festival, in February 2014. I was impressed, back then, by her talent and particularly by [her Radiohead's Karma Police cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzBds8f3TXE){:target="_blank"}. Lavina openly admires Philips Glass (seems we've got something in common here) and has already covered many of his piano songs (Metamorphoses being one of her best known). With her harp she covered among others, Olafur Arnalds, Wim Martens (what a masterpiece the 'Struggle for Pleasure'). In her performances, the last track is always the moment of surprise. This time, she covered part of the Apollo 13 movie soundtrack (adding her own talents and spices to it). As I couldn't resist, I made a little video, which you can check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b5iB-7gGhM){:target="_blank"}

Not only 'Kiss the Anus of a Black Cat' (K.T.A.O.A.B.C) is a band's name, but actually it is one of my favourites. Belgian people, nice people. I knew them as a dark fork, dark rock band. Lately, it seems they try to preserve their dark rock elements while replacing the folk with more electronic elements. In Incubate 2015 they performed mostly their last album 'Weltuutergangsstimmung' (I guess translated sounds something like 'gloom and doom').

Mark Kozelek is f*cking Mark Kozelek, as we called himself during his performance, and I bet noone doubted about the facts. He performed solo, he was perfect (no surprises here), and there is nothing more to be said. I'm a [lucky man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnv2y9cY2eE){:target="_blank"} to have seen him live...

The Soft Moon is a relatively new post-punk band from US. I'd heard their work before, but not being a real fun of the genre, I never paid enough attention. Of course, as pretty much always, it is enough to attend a first live performance in order to change one's mind. They performed (no news here) most songs of their latest (2015) album, yet honestly I've no clue how much and which of their older releases. Their energy and dynamics are both clearly captured in the photos. Legend has it that people who started listening to folk music first, at a certain moment they turn into rock/punk music and vice versa. I started listening to rock, moved to folk and seems like I'm becoming a punk. I hope I'll be left with some hair in the end, to paint. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iigmNuZRlqU]

Among others, French are good in shoegaze & post-rock bands, and one of their best representatives is Alcest. Their 2014 release 'Shelter' remains high in the list of my favourite post-rock albums. The performance took place inside an old chapel (Dudok) which nowadays is transformed into a concert venue. Dudok is an ideal place for shoegazing, in which Î™ engaged myself. I spent some time, indeed, staring at those boots without laces. Unfortunately, I left the venue halfway (had to catch last trains and all), so I can't have a clear opinion on the entire performance. The sound was superb, though, as it fits to a superb post-rock band.

When one listens to a song [like this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wL_JE_ksh8){:target="_blank"}, one expects an indie, krautrock band. It is hard to accept the fact that all thdse sounds come from machines and instruments controlled by a single person! British artist William Doyle is the one and only member of 'East India Youth'. He may be [looking for someone in his song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeMmpfZhNoc){:target="_blank"}, but for sure he doesn't really need anyone for his band. He satisfied both himself and his audience all alone. Actually you can enjoy him in action, performing 'Turn Away' [right here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdhbZ88UjD8){:target="_blank"}

Husky is an indie-folk band from Australia, and as I always have been saying, there might be something in the waters of Australia which renders people into great folk songwriters. The main singer, Husky Gawenda, wrote the songs for his band while walking around his neighbourhood and sitting at local coffee shops. Among other stories, he confessed that his song ['Hunter'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67bjmpLHQAw){:target="_blank"} (I enjoyed it a lot), is a product of his recurrent nightmares related to a certain girl!

I would never have known House of Wolves, if I didn't follow certain people on-line (this time credits go to Alevizon [for this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WfCt2x_Ff8){:target="_blank"}. I was severely attracted to their first album ('Fold in the Wind', 2013), especially the tracks '50's' & 'Ageless'. The band's name from California comes actually from the singer's Spanish last name (Rey Villalobos). In Incubate 2015 they performed without trumpets and pianos, which rendered their sound even more delicate than it is already. The truth is, although I missed both instruments, sweetness was flowing in the air. You can  [check here their live performance of "50's"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf_qRtQlwXs){:target="_blank"}

Torres (aka Mackenzie Scott) is only 24 years old. I was expecting a timid 'brunette' girl, or something close to that. Well, nothing like that, at least in the appearances. My expectations matched the facts, though, when it came to sound. I know her since here first album [('Torres', 2013)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa1cbq1Gqps){:target="_blank"} which I took a fancy to. In her songs, Torres knows well how to balance between darkness and light. The band performed songs from both their first and new album [('Sprinter', 2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6SIw30IOt8){:target="_blank"}. By the way, I honestly loved Mackenzie's socks!

There comes a moment when one realizes there is an 80's band which everyone (OK, almost everyone) knows, yet one completely ignores. The feeling is even more devastating when one enters the venue, and sees around 3000 people listening to Mercury Rev. That is the so called WTF moment. From Incubate's site, one reads : "Plenty of bands advocate anarchy, but few have practised it with the single-minded determination of Mercury Rev, a psychedelically inclined sextet given over to every-man-for-himself excursions as open-ended as 'pop' music has seen in many years. At Incubate, Mercury Rev plays an exclusive show together with the Tilburg Conservatorium orchestra." How could I miss all this? Perhaps because the band's name was one of those front big-letters which I usually bypass. This American alternative-psychedelic-indie-pop-rock-whatever band has a long history, apparently, and is all future to me... During the concert, the band's frontman Jonathan Donahue narrated stories, stirred up with emotional abundance, behind his songs. I recall particularly the story behind the ["Opus 40"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fusKcZjj7dg){:target="_blank"} from the 'Deserted Songs' which was written during a heavy storm, and in (yet another) period of their darkness.

A double drumming band is something not to be missed. K-X-P, one of Finland's best dark-electronic/krautrock bands, consists of three members, two of which hit the drums. They call their gender 'esoteric space rock', a term that initially made me laugh, yet five minutes of live performance was enough to be convinced of the validity of the nomenclature. I tried hard to decode some of their lyrics, but, as I was getting lost deeper in their rhythm, I gave up. I was waiting patiently for the lovely moments when they occasionally cross hands or drumsticks.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nV88Ks9Oys ]

What would be a better place for Thomas Jefferson Cowgill's (aka King Dude) show than a real church! Although a protestant one, thus minimalistic and void of ritual paraphernalia, PaulusKerk in Tilburg's centre is still an operational church. And no one can argue that the church has never been that crowded before. King Dude calls the music genre he advocates as ['Luciferian'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-8TkWJVMX8){:target="_blank"}, actually a mixture of folk, neofolk and dark-folk elements. He loves spirituality, good or evil, and many of his songs are inspired by both sides. Yet, one wonders whether spirituality is all about good or evil. A thing is certain, King Dude's musical sermons are spirituality good. The concert opened with the sound of the church's own organ performed by Burial Hex's Clay Ruby. King Dude with his guitar performed solo with noticeable song ["Jesus in the Courtyard"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiSnI8vyxx0){:target="_blank"}. Lights and acoustics not being optimal (strange enough for a church), I listened to him describing the difference between modern Baptist churches (those he is familiar with) and the one he was singing.

SÃ³ley StefÃ¡nsdÃ³ttir and her band from Iceland performed almost concurrently with King Dude, thus I had to steal the last 15 minutes from the later; both artists are hard to resist, so the choice was tough! During her performance, SÃ³ley asked the attendees whether they are going to have fun that night. Someone replied with a "certainly" word, only for her smiling [Pretty Face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRwFRMGpTWg){:target="_blank"} to change expression as her thoughts were openly back in Iceland in her baby. Their performance was perfect, as expected. Supreme (almost like studio) sound quality even in an open area space. ["Ask the Deep"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boKo7yLyDn8){:target="_blank"} is the title of their new (2015) album. 

Cabaret Voltaire is nowadays just Richard H. Kirk, his machines & multi-screen projections. I was expecting a revival, but the performance featured exclusively new material (flamboyant noise better said) and nothing from the great avant-garde past, not even a minute of nostalgia. I spent 20 minutes [listening to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDcRH0bCmQ){:target="_blank"} only to realize how lucky I am for my ears are not made for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDcRH0bCmQ){:target="_blank"}.

I'm not really fun of Funk or R&B music, yet there is this psychedelic/lo-fi element that attracts me to 'Unknown Mortal Orchestra'. This rather new band from New Zeeland/American band attracts more people by day. They played "old" and new songs.

In a line-up with more than 300 artists/bands, it is normal to surpass a name in those long lists. On my way back to the train station, I passed by the pub "De Harmonie" and from he glass inside I encountered a rather familiar face singing on an adhoc stage. Without a second thought, I looked at the agenda, only to realize it was Corrina Repp. Without realizing it, I found myself sitting inside the bar. I had heard her work in the past, even liked her facebook page, but for some reason I hadn't realized she was performing at Incubate 2015. I strongly believe it was one of the best performances in the festival. After her show (unfortunately I missed the first part), instead of disappearing, Corrina came down the podium and offered drinks to some of her acquaintances. It was the only moment in the festival I could exchange a couple of words with an artist.

Canadian band Great Lake Swimmers opened my last day's performances at Incubate. I love this folk band as much as I love the sound of banjo, and particularly the sounds coming of their banjo. Apparently in their last album (A Forest of Arms, 2015) they have given the banjo a rest. They started with their new album with most noticeable the ['I Must Have Someone Else's Blues'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq8PiCkOQMg){:target="_blank"}, for which front-man Tony Dekker asked the audience to sing along. Well, noone wants to mess around with someone else's blues, but still there were some of us singing along. At this point, dear reader, you ought to congratulate me for keeping my body still and [managing to record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-BlLlZ9eKg){:target="_blank"} one of my favourite songs ('Your Rocky Spine') from their third album ('Ongiara', 2007). Alas, I had to leave before their finale so I could attend the next concert (about 15 km away). I was actually waiting patiently to hear my all time favourite['I could be nothing'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34MEoGEaQM0){:target="_blank"} but (I hope and I'm quite sure) they kept it for the end. If only I could spend a bit more time with them!

I take for granted that all dark music lovers met or at least know Kim Larsen (aka :Of the Wand & the Moon:) from Denmark. He performed solo with his guitar, at which I was staring for almost all 45 minutes of his performance. I wonder whether anyone can read the runic script on his guitar! With his exceptional talent, Kim is capable of capturing his audience's attention even of those not attracted to his style. The venue, a 80 years old [open amphitheatre in Oisterwijk](http://www.natuurtheater.nl/){:target="_blank"}, somewhere in Tilburg's countryside, was absolutely the best possible setting for this performance. The alluring voice of Kim mixed with the shadows of the surrounding trees harmonically composed a lovely sunset setting. He played songs from various albums with most noticeable ['I Crave For You'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBKj_IHog40){:target="_blank"} and ['Lost in Emptiness'] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDVog7luAbY){:target="_blank"}. Kim was apparently thirsty during his concert, for he was drinking a sip of beer every other song, saying "Drinky time!". I love both his spirit and his voice.

Empyrium is the band that gave birth and shape to [Prophecy](http://www.prophecy.de/){:target="_blank"} productions, a record label associated with lots of artists in the dark-folk, dark-rock, post-rock and neofolk world (K.T.A.O.A.B.C, Alcest, VÃ li, Sol Invictus, Tenhi, LantlÃ´s, Les Discrets, Darkher, are just a few to name). Moreover, is the band that made me start listening to metal. Their third album  ('Songs Of Moors and Misty Fields', 1997), although is considered as their last 'doom metal' album, for my is one of the most melodic metal albums ever written. Empyrium performed full band, right after Of the Wand & the Moon. Most of the songs where from the latest albums, whereas one of them entitled 'Mile' is released just a day before the concert! Needless to describe the infinite joy I felt to the sound of their ( therefore my own private Incubate's) last song, my favourite waltz 'Many moons ago..." [here in an older performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOxJrSkRqR4){:target="_blank"}.
Life is, and will always be a waltz...
