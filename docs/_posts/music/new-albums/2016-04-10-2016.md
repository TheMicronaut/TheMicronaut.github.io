Here is a weekly-updated timeline of (so far #<span id="amountxmldata"></span>) albums released within 2016 and fit our tastes. In fact this is our captain's logbook for 2016. The spectrum of genres here is rather wide I believe, yet all albums can be commonly characterized as *alternative music*. We advice you to not only scroll it, but also listen to it. You have recommendations? we would be more than happy to read your comments and include your proposals into the list. Don't waste time, start listening and have fun.

**Note:** You may freely reuse and redistribute this list of albums. You can download a copy in xml format [here]({{ page.xmldata.data }}){:target="_blank"}.

**Note:** By any means, always show your support to independent artists and labels.
