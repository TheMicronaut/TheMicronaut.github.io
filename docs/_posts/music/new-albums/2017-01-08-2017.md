Here is a weekly-updated timeline of (so far #<span id="amountxmldata"></span>) albums released within 2017 which fit our taste; in fact this is our captain's logbook of the year. The spectrum of genres is rather wide, yet all albums can be commonly described as *alternative music*. We advice you to not only scroll through but also listen to the songs. You have any recommendations? We would be more than happy to read your comments and include your proposals into this list. Don't waste time... start listening and have fun.

**Note:** You may freely reuse and redistribute this list of albums. You can download a copy in xml format [here]({{ page.xmldata.data }}){:target="_blank"}.

**Note:** By any means, always show your support to independent artists and labels.
